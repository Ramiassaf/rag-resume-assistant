# 🧠 RAG Resume Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)–powered assistant that helps HR teams or recruiters quickly screen resumes based on skills and experience.  
This project uses **Phi-2**, a lightweight LLM from Microsoft, integrated with **LangChain** and **ChromaDB** for retrieval.

## 🚀 Features
-  Upload and parse resumes (PDF or text)
-  Retrieve the top-matching candidates for specific skills or roles
-  Query the assistant interactively through a **Gradio** UI
-  Uses embeddings for semantic search (MiniLM)
-  Runs seamlessly on **RunPod** GPU instances for faster inference

## Architecture
1. **Document Loading** – Upload resumes and split them into chunks.  
2. **Embedding Generation** – Convert text into numerical embeddings using MiniLM.  
3. **Vector Store (ChromaDB)** – Store embeddings for semantic retrieval.  
4. **Retriever + LLM (Phi-2)** – Combine retrieved chunks with a prompt to answer recruiter queries.  
5. **Gradio UI** – Simple chat interface for interacting with the assistant.
